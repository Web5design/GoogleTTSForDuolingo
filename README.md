GoogleTTSForDuolingo
====================

A Google Chrome extension to use Google's Text-to-Speech engine in Duolingo.

To Luis, Severin, and the Duolingo team: Thank you so much for all your hard work on Duolingo.  It's truly an amazing
and awesome tool, and I'm excited to see it come so far.  As a user of Duolingo myself, I am extraordinarily pleased
with just about everything, save for just a few small things.  One thing I've had a problem with is the TTS engine, and
I've read the same complaint a number of times.  It's very difficult to understand at times, especially French.  I'm
sure you've heard the same feedback, and I imagine you are under constraints to use the TTS engine you have.  That 
said, I built this little extension just to insert Google's TTS on the fly.  If there's an issue with this extension,
or you want to modify it, please let me know.
